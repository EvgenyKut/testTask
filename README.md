Welcome to my test-task for Cashew!

Business Requirements
As a user, we should be able to log in using me username or email, and password.
1. If me username or password is correct, we will navigate the user to dashboard
route, and showing his email on the header.
2. If the email or email was incorrect, we must show an error message.

Data we can use from https://reqres.in/ (you can find users emails in the list of users (for test you can give one: rachel.howell@reqres.in, byron.fields@reqres.in)

When you clone the project:
<br/>
:zap: <b>npm install</b> /--/ <b>yarn</b>  for installing libraries and dependencies.
<br/>
:rocket: <b>npm start</b> /--/ <b>yarn start</b>  for launch

Happy hacking!

For real projects better to use HttpOnly system.
